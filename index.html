		<p> The <u><b>first vacation</b></u> I ever went on was with my family out west.  We went to <u>California</u>, 
		<u>Utah</u>, <u>Nevada</u> and many more.  One place that we went was the Sequoais National Park in 
		<u>California</u>.  These trees amazed me because of their great size and beauty. </p></u>
		</u>
		<br/><br/><br/><hr/>
		<p> Another place I went on this vacation was the Grand Canyon.  The Grand Canyon was so large that I was in 
		shock and it made me think about how small I was.  All I could think about was the thought what if I could fly?
		Then I could jump in and fly wherever I wanted to.  That has always been my biggest fantasy. </p>

		<p> The first country I visited outside of the <u>United States</u> and <u>Canada</u> was <u>Costa Rica</u>. 
		I went to <u>Costa Rica</u> with my family when I was <u>ten years old</u>.  When my family goes on vacation, 
		we do not go to touristy places, instead we stay where the locals live, somewhat.  I love traveling, because 
		I love going to the beach, eating exotic foods and speaking with the local people of each destination.  
		Family vacations are my favorite things.</p>
